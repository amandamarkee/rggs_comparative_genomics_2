# RGGS Comparative Genomics 2 — Computational Methods
Materials for the American Museum of Natural History-Richard Gilder Graduate School course: Comparative Genomics 2 — Computational Methods.

This course is conducted by Rob Desalle, Jose Barba, and Dean Bobo. (Update instructors list). 

The course takes place on Thursdays from 2:00 to 4:00 PM in the ICG conference room, from September 5 to December 12, 2024.

## Course description
This project-oriented course introduces students to the computational tools necessary for interpreting modern
molecular sequencing data. It covers whole genome and transcriptome assembly, comparative analyses using
both de novo and reference-based methods, and phylogenomic inference. Designed for non-model systems,
the course emphasizes documentation, reproducibility, and proficiency with computational tools. Students will
address experimental questions starting from raw data, aiming to lay a foundation for a publishable final
product. Students are encouraged to use their own data for assignments and a course project. Those without
personal data should select an appropriate dataset to work with. Evaluation will be based on student
participation, performance on quizzes and homework assignments, in-class presentations, and a final project.
Students will receive individual guidance on applying methods relevant to their research and data. This support
will include using their own datasets for tutorials and homework assignments, as well as consultations with
instructors to discuss their data and appropriate bioinformatic methods. For more details, refer to the course syllabus. (Update link to syllabus).
