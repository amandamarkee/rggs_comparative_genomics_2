# RGGS Comparative Genomics 2 — Computational Methods
Materials for the American Museum of Natural History-Richard Gilder Graduate School course: Comparative Genomics 2 — Computational Methods.

This course is conducted by Rob Desalle, Jose Barba, Jessica Goodhart, and Dean Bobo. (Update instructors list). 

The course takes place on Thursdays from 2:00 to 4:00 PM in the ICG conference room, from September 5 to December 12, 2024.

## Course description
This project-based course introduces computational tools for interpreting molecular sequencing data, focusing on genome and transcriptome assembly, comparative analyses (both de novo and reference-based), and phylogenomic inference. Emphasizing documentation, reproducibility, and computational proficiency, students will work through experimental questions from raw data to publishable results. Students are encouraged to use their own data or select an appropriate dataset.
